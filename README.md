# Laughable Lyrics
Created by Mark Fonte and Nathan Johnson at SpartaHack V

Take the English lyrics of any song and translate them to another language, and then back to English. The result is usually not the same as the original input. Do this multiple times before translating back to English, and you can get some pretty funny results. 

Laughable Lyrics is an Android app that lets you do this easily for any song, but also sings the newly remixed lyrics to you for maximum comedy.

How does it work?
1. Choose a song and the number of translation stages
2. The language for each translation stage will either be randomly chosen by Laughable Lyrics or selected by you
3. Laughable Lyrics will sing the new translation-remixed lyrics 
4. Share a link to the result with friends, or even try singing it yourself!
